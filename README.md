# WAT

A little change to the original mailhog docker container to run it as root so we can bind :25 too

# Usage

All the configuration from https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog but start it with


```
   docker run eugenmayer/mailhog-root
```

# Credits

Please send them all to https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog
